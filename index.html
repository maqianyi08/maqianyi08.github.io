		<h1>Ma Qianyi</h1>
		<h5>From a baseball kid to a baseball man</h5>
		<p>I started playing baseball at the age of seven, won the Beijing championship in the sixth grade, and participated in the World Championships on behalf of the Chinese Junior National Team. When I was in high school, I didnâ€™t play for two years because of academic stress. I won the Beijing championship again in college. Baseball has taught me a lot and it has become a part of my life.</p>
